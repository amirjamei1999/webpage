      <p>nowadays technology take an important place in our lives. Imagine when smart phones weren’t invent yet. Every person has many devices such as lap top , smart phone , smart watch and so on. Technology upgrade every day and put olds out of the market. For example in these days people buy smart watch instead of regular watch which only shows you the time. In my opinion, most interesting thing in technology is programming. Imagine you open a huge and well equipped store that cost you a high amount of money. In start you do well and everything goes well. Suddenly a programmer sitting behind his computer and stablish a page by web programming and web designing called amazon. The main subject in programming is about creating and idea you have to be creative. What enforce Zuckerberg to invent facebook? Maybe breaking up with his girlfriend. The point is you have to get idea from everything and everyone around you.
        for begin must tell I was always fascinated by computer. When I was a little kid I spend my whole day sitting behind the computer and spend my time with that. Most of my activities was playing videogames. My using of computer was less when gaming consules came to the scene.
        When I went to high school I decided to choose mathematics and physics for beginning of my academic career. At first I wasn’t interest in mathematics and to be honest I wasn’t good at it at all. But when I got older and specially when I went to university I realized that I made the right choice.
        To enter public universities in iran, which are very popular and highly regarded in and out of the country, every student has to pass an exam at the end of 12 years of study. I participated in this exam in the year 2017, and I was admitted to enter universities.
        After graduation from high school I wanted to study information technology (IT) and I was only interest in that. But for some reasons I had to choose mechanical engineering of biosystem ( biosystems engineering ) in agricultural sciences and natural resources university of Khuzestan. I went to university and actually it was a good experience and great opportunity to be in environment of university. Whereas I was studying mechanic in university, I improved my knowledge particularly in mathematics. As mathematical prerequisites, Calculus 1 and 2, Differential Equations and Statistics helped me gain more insight towards various disciplines.
        While I was study mechanic, I was still interest in computer and programming. I learned HTML and CSS and I want to learn all programming languages. I like all computer science courses such as data science , cyber security , programming , cloud engineering and particularly artificial intelligence.
        If I success in my course which I’m sure that I would, I could expand my knowledge and hire in a company or work as a freelancer or even both. I have ability and interest to create new things and ideas. I think my intelligence is match to this subject.
        Also I choose Canada because I heard from many of my friends that it’s a great country and there are so many opportunities in there. There are so many cultures in there and I have chance to communicate with people from different part of the world. Besides I have couple of friends who suggested me to move there and it’s a good point.
        Also I choose Seneca college in Toronto because it’s a well-known college in Canada and even in the world. In the other hand I have a friend in Toronto who lives in there and he knows every college and university in there and he told me it’s a very good choice and he also included that this college provide place for students.
